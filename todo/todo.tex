\section{TODOs (Unordered)}
\begin{itemize}
\item  \code{Node.execute(self, command: str): \{result: int, data: str\}} \\
Method for accessing a \code{Node}'s command line and execute a command on it. (3)
\item \code{Node.plug\_in(self, link: Link, port: int): None}\\
Plug in one end of a \code{Link} into the \code{Node}'s port. (2)
\item \code{Link.unplug(self, node): None}\\
Unplug only one end of the link, which is plugged into the the node. (2)
\item \code{Link.destroy(self): None}\\
Unplug the \code{Link} on both ends. Acts like destructor and is invoked when \code{del Link} is called. (1)
\item \code{Link.reconnect(self, end=None): None}\\
Reverts the \code{Link} to the previous state, where both ends (or only the one given in \code{end}) were plugged in.  (2)
\item \code{Node.link\_to(self, other): Link}\\
Calls \code{Link.create(self, other)} and returns result.  (1)
\item \code{Link.create(node\_a, node\_b): Link}\\ 
Creates a \code{Link} object based off two \code{Node}s. (1) \\
Optional: Overload the constructor thus that it can differ between direct and indirect construction.
\item Refactor the code in order to increase readability. Focus lays on splitting (clusters of) classes between files. \\
Create \code{Refactoring} branch for this purpose. (2)

\end{itemize}
